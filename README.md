# STAT-442-Final-Project-Moriarty
Source code and raw data used for my STAT 442 final project analyzing soybean yield data.

This project focuses on soybean yield data from the 2021 growing season. The main objective is to observe how yield varies within a single field and look for patterns in the data to identify areas where we can adjust farming strategies to improve performance. To do this, we began by visualizing the data, creating yield maps as well as mapping other variables associated with harvest to identify any similar patterns. We found some key similarities between yield and both the field elevation and speed variables. Finally, to analyze the apparent clustering of yield values seen in the yield map, we used a Global Moran’s I test to determine whether spatial autocorrelation was present in the field. Given the affirmative result of this test, we then calculated the Local Moran’s I value for each yield point in the field, and found which points had statistically significant autocorrelations, indicating that there was a strong relationship between the yields at those points and their neighboring points. Mapping these significant points showed that they corresponded to the apparent clustering in the original data; thus, we were able to identify regions within the field that could be specifically targeted to improve performance.
